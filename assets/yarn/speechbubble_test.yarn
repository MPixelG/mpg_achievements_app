// The parser now knows who "BubbleMaster" is from the global declarations.
BubbleMaster: Greetings! I am the BubbleMaster. I'm here to test the dialogue system.

// Test 2: Sequential lines to ensure the completer logic works.
BubbleMaster: This is the first line of a sequence. Please click to continue.
BubbleMaster: And this is the second. When you proceed, we'll get to the interesting part.

// Test 3: A long line to check text wrapping and animation duration.
BubbleMaster: This next line is going to be quite a bit longer to make sure that the text wrapping inside the speech bubble is working as expected and doesn't overflow or look strange. It should handle multiple lines gracefully.

// Test 4: A line attributed to the default 'Player' character.
Player: (This is a line from the player's perspective. It should appear over my head.)

// Test 5: Jump to a new node that handles choices.
BubbleMaster: Now, for your first test... a choice!

// This node tests the 'onChoiceStart' and 'onChoiceSelected' logic.
BubbleMaster: Please choose one of the options below. Your selection will change my response.

// Choice 1: A standard, available choice.
-> Option 1: Tell me about variables.
    <<set $knows_variables to true>>
    BubbleMaster: An excellent choice! Variables let us remember things.
    <<jump VariablePath>>

// Choice 2: Another standard choice leading to a different path.
-> Option 2: Just end the test.
    BubbleMaster: As you wish. We can skip straight to the end.
    <<jump EndPath>>

// Choice 3: A disabled choice.
-> Option 3: This option is disabled. <<if false>>
    BubbleMaster: You shouldn't be able to see this line.

BubbleMaster: Because you made that choice, I have set a variable called `$knows_variables` to true in my memory.

<<if $knows_variables is true>>
    BubbleMaster: This line is only visible because the `$knows_variables` variable is true. This confirms our conditional logic is working.
<<else>>
    BubbleMaster: You should not be seeing this line. It means the conditional logic failed.
<<endif>>

BubbleMaster: Now, let's proceed to the end.

BubbleMaster:

BubbleMaster: This concludes the test of the speech bubble and dialogue system.
BubbleMaster: Everything seems to be in order. Farewell!
